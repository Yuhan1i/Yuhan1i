Welcome to my GitHub. Currently, I am a 2nd-year PhD student at HKUST. My research lies at the intersection of Graphs and Large Language Models – with a special focus on "graph foundation model", "graph retrieval-augmented generation", etc. If you have any questions about my projects, please feel free to send me an email(yuhanli98@gmail.com). Check my [homepage](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c8DzpkAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to learn more about me.

*P.S. My previous GitHub account **@yhLeeee** was suspended due to Copilot-related issues. You can find my work, including [Awesome-LLMs-in-Graph-tasks](https://github.com/yhLeeee/Awesome-LLMs-in-Graph-tasks) (500+ stars), in that account.*

Feel free to contact me by email if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.
